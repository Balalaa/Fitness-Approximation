# Fitness-Approximation

This project was created in the process of writing a paper("Is it worth to approximate fitness function by machine learning")
## Abstract  
It is usual to need an approximate model in evolutionary
computation when fitness function is deemed to be abstract or
expected to have a long computation time. In these cases, research
on possibility of fitness approximation should proceed before
applying an evolutionary algorithm in real-world problems. In this
paper, it was found that we could train machine learning
algorithms with the sampled solutions when problem size is large,
if there is a possibility of fitness approximation at small problem
sizes.
